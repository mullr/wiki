This is a partial list of projects formalizing mathematics in Coq. If your project is missing, please add it.

* The [[http://c-corn.cs.ru.nl|Constructive Coq repository at Nijmegen]] (C-CoRN) aims at building a computer based library of constructive mathematics. Started in 1999 with a proof of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra|Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]] and of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]], the project covers constructive algebraic structures, metric spaces, effective real analysis.

* The [[http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/Projects/math-components|Mathematical Components]] group develops libraries in group theory and algebra leading to a full formalization of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odd_order_theorem|odd order theorem]] (Feit-Thompson theorem).  This group also organized a [[http://www-sop.inria.fr/manifestations/MapSpringSchool/|spring school on the formalization of mathematics]] in 2012.

* The [[http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/ForMath/ForMath|ForMath]] project gathers researchers from Gothenburg, Nijmegen, Paris-Saclay and La Rioja. It aims at developing
libraries of formalized mathematics concerning algebra, linear algebra, real number computation, and algebraic topology. 

* Russell O'Connor formalized [[http://r6.ca/Goedel/goedel1.html|Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] on his own in 2003.

* Elements of category theory have been early formalized by Amokrane Saïbi in 1995. Other formalizations are conducted by André Hirschowitz's group at Nice University. [[http://git.megacz.com/?p=coq-categories.git;a=tree;f=src;h=df71fb8e531789e82730661edb273dbb3b2f7229;hb=master|Adam Megacz]] also contributes some libraries.

* Formalizations of geometry have been conducted at INRIA Sophia Antipolis by Frédérique Guilhot and Loïc Pottier. Other formalizations are conducted by Julien Narboux, Nicolas Magaud, Pascal Schreck and Jean-François Dufourd at Strasbourg's university, and by Jean Duprat at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon.

* At the Mathematical school of the Institute of Advanced Studies, Vladimir Voevodsky is working on the [[http://www.math.ias.edu/~vladimir/Site3/Univalent_Foundations.html|foundations]] of type theory from a homotopy perspective.

* Exact real arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic are investigated by Guillaume Melquiond, Sylvie Boldo, Micaela Mayero, as part of the [[http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/gappa/|Gappa]], [[https://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/projects/pff/|pff]] and [[http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/|Flocq]] libraries.
