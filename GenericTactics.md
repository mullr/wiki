== GenericTactics ==

=== Rationale ===
A tactic like {{{auto}}} is powerful in theory, but in practice it too often can not do anything on the goal just because in a series of, say, 5 steps, the last can not be done by {{{auto}}}. So in practice, it sometimes is more effective to write some domain-specific tactic ''t'' in Ltac, doing only some small invertible reasonning step and, to call {{{repeat}}} ''t''.

The following code elaborates on this idea: Ltac can be used to build a generic solver tactic, taking as arguments invertible and non-invertible tactics, and applying a standard iterative deepening search using non-invertible tactics and normalizing the goal at each depth using invertible tactics. You can think of it as a parameterized {{{intuition}}} tactic ({{{intuition}}} can be parameterized this facility is very limited : you can only customize the way it ''solves'' atoms; there is no way to add some specific behavior in order to, say, make it unfold some definitions or rewrite some terms, or ...)

I (JudicaelCourant) define some domain-specific tactics in my developments, extending the invertible and/or non-invertible tactics given in the next section and I apply the generic search tactic to my tactic. For instance, in a case study I am currently conducting with Jean-FranÃ§ois Monin, I defined the following {{{progress1}}} tactic:

{{{#!coq
Ltac progress1 g := match goal with
  | [ |- step_up ?f ?z (?u::?x) ] => apply step_up_snoc2
  | [ H : continuous ?f |- _ ] => unfold continuous in H
  end
  || progress0 g.
}}}

Then I defined {{{splitsolve1}}} as the following shorthand:
{{{#!coq
Ltac splitsolve1 n := splitsolve progress1 split0 noni0 n 0.
}}}

And I use {{{splitsolve1 0}}}, ..., {{{splitsolve1 2}}} to work on my goals.

Even with no customisation, {{{splitsolve0}}} (given below) is surprisingly effective. For instance, in my current case study, I found that I could replace the following steps:
{{{
intros m H y.
simpl.
rewrite H.
ring.
}}}
with a single {{{splitsolve0 0}}} (in fact, {{{intros;simpl;omega}}} would also work, but I did not figure it out at first as the goal was quite complex; {{{splitsolve0}}} did).

=== Coq code ===

(* A repeat tactical for one-argument tactics. Unlike repeat, the
   tactic is applied at least once.
*)
Ltac repeat1 t g := t g; repeat (t g).

(* A tactic is said invertible whenever its application does not
   change the provability of the goal.

   In the following we use the following terminology:
   * progressing tactics: invertible tactics generating at most one
       subgoal
   * splitting tactics: invertible tactics potentially generating
       several subgoal
   * solving tactics: solve the goal or fail
   * non-invertible tactics.
   * non-invertible mapping: a parameterized tactic [t], taking as
       argument a solver [s], applying some non-invertible tactic
       followed by [s] on the generated subgoals.
*)

(* [rsplit pro spl] tries to solve the goal, using the progressing
   tactic [pro] and the splitting tactic [spl]. [g] is a dummy
   argument. This tactic is splitting.
*)
Ltac rsplit pro spl g :=
  let t g := (spl g; try repeat1 pro g) in
  let rt g := repeat1 t g in
  let t2 g := repeat1 pro g in
  tacsum t2 rt g.

Ltac myfail g := fail.

(* [solver_dfs pro spl noni n g] is a depth-first search solving
   tactic, where:
   * [pro] is progressing
   * [spl] is splitting
   * [noni] is a non-invertible mapping
   * n is the depth of search
   * g is a dummy argument
*)
Ltac solver_dfs pro spl noni n g :=
  try rsplit pro spl g;
  let t := match n with
           | O => myfail
           | S ?k => noni ltac:(solver_dfs pro spl noni k)
           end
  in t g.

(* [solver pro spl noni n g] is an iterative deepening search
   solving tactic where:
   * [pro] is progressing
   * [spl] is splitting
   * [noni] is a non-invertible mapping
   * n is the depth of search
   * g is a dummy argument
*)
Ltac solver pro spl noni n g :=
  let t :=
    match n with
    | O => solver_dfs pro spl noni 0
    | S ?k =>
      let u g := (solver pro spl noni k g || solver_dfs pro spl noni n g) in u
    end
  in t g.

(* [splitsolve pro spl noni n g] is a splitting tactic trying to
   solve the generated subgoals with [solver]
*)
Ltac splitsolve pro spl noni n g :=
  try rsplit pro spl g; try solver pro spl noni n g.


(* [everywhere t g] generalizes the whole goal, then applies g,
   then introduces previously generalized hyps and variable back.

   NB: we have to take care of 'match goal' non-determinism since
   we want a deterministic behaviour here: the first case must
   apply only on the last hypothesis of the context
*)
Ltac everywhere t g := match goal with

            | [ |- _ ] => t g
            end
end.

(* apply [t] on some hyp [H] by generalizing [H], applying [t]
   (and verifying it is progressing), then introducing [H] back.

Ltac autorew g := autorewrite with rew_db.

(* The base progress, splitting and non-invertible tactics I use.
   I do not pretend they have nice theoretical properties (besides
   being progressing, splitting and non-invertible) but they do the
   job for me. (I call them using [splitsolve0] below.)
