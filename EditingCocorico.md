Anyone can edit Cocorico.  However you must make an account and log in to do so.  You can create your account at the [[UserPreferences]] page.

Currently Cocorico is organized in a "shallow" fashion: the main page links directly to up-to-date articles.  Please follow this style when adding pages.  However, Cocorico's main page cannot be edited directly.  (We believe this mitigates spam problems.)  Instead, edit the [[Contents]] page.  Your changes will apparently never be reflected on the main page, nobody seems to be doing this.
