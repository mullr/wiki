[Coq](http://coq.inria.fr/) is a proof assistant based on the calculus of constructions. It is used to formalize proofs in a variety of fields, including mathematics and programming languages. Cocorico is the Coq wiki.

:warning: **Note**: this wiki is a clone of <https://coq.inria.fr/cocorico> and will probably subsume it, more information on this migration [here](WikiMigration).
