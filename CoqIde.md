Manual Installation in Debian
=============================

*(See also the instructions in the file* `$COQTOP/INSTALL.ide` *in your Coq distribution)*

If you want to install CoqIde but without using `apt-get install coqide`, in Debian `lenny` you can try:

`$ apt-get install liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev`

Then try installing Coq as usual using the instructions in `$COQTOP/INSTALL`.
