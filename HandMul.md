Here is a fun way to do multiplications by hand.<<BR>> Each hand represents a number.<<BR>> To represent six, we close all the fingers except the big one {{attachment:six.png}} .<<BR>>  This is seven {{attachment:seven.png}} . <<BR>>  This is eight {{attachment:eight.png}} . <<BR>> Finally this is nine {{attachment:nine.png}} <<BR>>.

Now we are ready to do 7 * 9, the left hand takes 7 the right one 9 {{attachment:seven.png}} {{attachment:rnine.png}} . <<BR>> Now, the idea is simple, the sum of the fingers up gives the tens, and the product of the fingers down the units.<<BR>> On our example 7 * 9, how many fingers are up? 6 (2 on the left, 4 on the right). Now for the units, 3 fingers down for the left hand, one for the right, so 3 units (3 * 1). Putting tens and units together we get 63. Magic!
