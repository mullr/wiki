Here is a fun way to do multiplications by hand.<<BR>>
Each hand represents a number.<<BR>>
To represent six, we close all the fingers
except the big one sixo.<<BR>> 
This is seven seveno. <<BR>> 
This is eight eighto. <<BR>>
Finally this is nine nineo <<BR>>.


Now we are ready to do 7 * 9, the left hand takes 7 the right one 9
seveno nineor.
<<BR>>
Now, the idea is simple, the sum of the fingers up gives
the tens, and the product of the fingers down the units.<<BR>>
On our example 7 * 9, how many fingers are up? 6 (2 on the left, 4 on the right). Now for the units, 3 fingers down for the left hand, one for the right, so 3 units (3 * 1).
Putting tens and units together we get 63. Magic!
