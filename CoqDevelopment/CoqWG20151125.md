Pierre Courtieu: (10 minutes maximum) how to do better than manually naming hypothesis

  I always thought that naming my hypothesis by hand was the best way to write script, then I realize that when changing a definition in a development I had to shift hypothesis names, add new names everywhere in my script. Even if the main part of the script was ok after that, this first step was still painful.
  I will show how a very simple user directed automatic naming scheme for hypothesis made my life easier. 
  The current implementation is in Ltac and not general enough but it should be easy to make something nice if implemented in ocaml, if you think it is worth it.
