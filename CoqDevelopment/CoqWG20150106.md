PPS, Sophie Germain.

If you intend to give a talk, please add your name and title here and any information you'd like to give.

Pierre Courtieu: (10 minutes maximum) how to do better than manually naming hypothesis

  I always thought that naming my hypothesis by hand was the best way to write script, then I realize that when changing a definition in a development I had to shift hypothesis names, add new names everywhere in my script. Even if the main part of the script was ok after that, this first step was still painful.
  I will show how a very simple user directed automatic naming scheme for hypothesis made my life easier. 
  The current implementation is in Ltac and not general enough but it should be easy to make something nice if implemented in ocaml, if you think it is worth it.

Marc Lasson: A new parametricity plugin for the coq proof assistant.

During this talk, I will present the implementation of a new plugin for the coq proof assistant. 
It implements the parametricity transformation which allows to generate the logical relations of
parametricity as well as the proof that all terms satisfies these relations. Both the proofs and the 
relations are defined by induction over syntax. I will introduce the various functionalities of the
plugin through concrete examples of practical applications.

If you have suggestions for discussions, questions broad or specific, please elaborate here.

 * Policy for pull requests: anonymity required? need for at least two reviews? guaranteeing answering delays?
 * Library/contribs: editorial board? community managment? licensing? (suggested by B. Spitters)
 * Policy: have code that does not require a particular OCaml version to run [[https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3831|One-liner segfault]]
 * Emit a warning for nested Lemma and the like
 * Discussion about nf_constraints + async proofs
