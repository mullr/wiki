== 10:00 - 10:15 Status of 8.5, calendar ==

31 bugs considered critical for 8.5 beta 3

  * Universes: 15 bugs
  * Compilation issues: 4 bugs (2 of them related to native compute)
  * Modules: 2 bugs
  * Print Assumption: 2 bugs (Print Assumption forgets to tell you that some axiom was used)
  * Coqchk: 2 bugs
  * STM: 2 bugs
  * Records: 1 bug
  * Compatibility: 1 wish (considered bad idea by Guillaume Melquiond)

We lack expertise for Modules, Print Assumptions, Coqchk

Hopefully, at the end of this day, we should have clarified what will become of most of these bugs.

What date are we targeting for a beta3?  Matthieu is hoping the end of September.

Hugo: for the Universe bugs, do they all have the same origin?
  * No, some of them are technical Ocaml stuff, but some of them are inconsistencies
  * Greg Malecha is looking at one of the bugs at the interface of vm_compute and universes

== 10:15 - 11:00 Organization of the development for 2015-2016 ==

- Building on the feedback that Yves got a few months ago, let's try to improve the development organization.

About shorter release cycles, is 6 months okay?  Should we announce release dates very early?

Pierre Marie: changing the process on release, also means changing the process on branch management.

Do we still release PL for most serious bugs?

- Maxime advocates decorrelating what is in trunk from what is going to appear in the release, and make sure we have a lot of branches.

- The solution advocated is a lot of work for the person integrating the release.

- Enrico thinks that the integrator should actually be helped by the branch managers, so that most of the merge conflicts have already been studied by each of the branch managers.

This solution makes that when you merge there is less fear to merge wrong stuff, because you know it is still going into a draft.

Enrico thinks that people working on academic schedule would be ill at ease with releases every 6 months, because their schedule is more constrained by a year cycle.

Enrico: if we produce a release every 6 months, we have to expect that users are going to follow us.  This depends on how much things we break at each release.
 
It is not clear whether users will prefer to have something that breaks often in small ways.
