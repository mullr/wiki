= Organization =

The WG was held in Paris on July 8th at PPS, Sophie Germain, 10am.

= Participants =

Yves Bertot, Maxime Dénès, Hugo Herbelin, Guillaume Melquiond, Pierre Letouzey, Cyprien Mangin, Pascal Manoury, Thomas Sibut-Pinote, Matthieu Sozeau, Enrico Tassi.

= Talks =

 * Pascal Manoury: An ordinal measure for proof termination (diapos: [[attachment:gtcoq.pdf]])

= Talking points =

 * Pull requests from the CoqCS

   * Most pull requests are for trunk, and this is postponed

 * Document opam archive / contribs on Coq's www

   * Constatation of some progresses
   * Majority against guaranteeing that submitted packages will be maintained from one version of Coq to the other: the idea is that the developers will do "best effort"

 * Status of v8.5

  * we shall do a beta3 and Matthieu is appointed responsible of the finalization of the 8.5
  * reminder: only bug fixes to be committed in 8.5 (e.g. f_equal to be solved for 8.6)
  * developers shal mark in documentation and CHANGES their features which are not stable yet (e.g. universe polymorphism)

 * Reflections on development organization (Yves Bertot)

   See [https://pad.inria.fr/p/QkAmQ3AzUMNB1WaK_Devenir-Coq].

 * Miscellaneous

   * Mail traffic from github: we shall use a specific list, different from coqdev
   * Discussion about sympa for coq-club: search is painful, no indexing; a possible alternative is to use gmane.
   * discussion about a few committing rules:
      * to start commit messages by a 80-line description followed by a blank line; the body of the commit message comes after (idea: will serve for the change log)
      * no constraint on removing spaces at end of lines
      * avoid obfuscating a semantic change with syntactic changes (which cannot be hidden with "git diff -w")
      * it is recommended to limit the lines to 80 characters in files
   * use of ocamlfind: consensus for following the move of the community towards using it, even though it is not necessary for compiling Coq
   * immutable strings [https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4278] (skipped)
   * Primitive projection representation (skipped)
   * left2right ref in kernel (skipped)
