Warning: the following notes only describe a small part of the discussion
                                                                                                                                  
Jean-Marc proposes an architecture where each contrib is made of:                                                                 
* "description"                                                                                                                   
* "sources" avec scripts pour http, svn, git                                                                                      
* Coq dev provided "patches"                                                                                                      
* "versions"                                                                                                                      
together with a recommendation to authors to set branches for each Coq                                                            
version 8.3, 8.4, trunk                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
Pierre C: Question of dependence of a contrib in another one: what to do if living contrib A is updated and breaks the compilation                                                            
  of contrib B which depends on it: who is responsible                                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
Note: 143 contribs (over 154) compiled in less than 10mns                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
Question: continuous checks rather than fixed hour checks                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
Several kinds of contribs e.g.:                                                                                                   
* RSA: only local                                                                                                                 
* CoLoR: developed upstream                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
Two configurations:                                                                                                               
* upstream publishes for a stable version                                                                                         
  * one downloads the last upstream version for stable version 8.x                                                                
    for each V in 8.x, 8.3, 8.4, trunk one applies our 8.x-to-V patches;                                                          
  * patching might fail or succeed, compilation can then fail or succeed                                                          
* upstream follows Coq trunk                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
Developers will have to prepare guidelines for library contributors.
