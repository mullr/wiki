Mathematics Formalized in Coq
=============================

There is a great deal of mathematics already formalized in Coq. Some of the material is available in the [StandardLibrary](StandardLibrary) or in the Coq's repository of [user contributions](http://coq.inria.fr/contribs-eng.html).

-   [Top100MathematicalTheoremsInCoq](Top100MathematicalTheoremsInCoq): a list of theorems among the [Top 100 Mathematical Theorems](Top100MathematicalTheorems) that are formalised in Coq (see also <http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/>).
-   [CoRN](CoRN) : a large library of formalised mathematics built on top of Coq
