= Mathematics Formalized in Coq =

There is a great deal of mathematics already formalized in Coq. Some of the material is available in the [[http://coq.inria.fr/library-eng.html|Standard Library]] or in the Coq's repository of [[http://coq.inria.fr/contribs-eng.html|user contributions]].

 * Top100MathematicalTheoremsInCoq: a list of theorems among the [[Top100MathematicalTheorems|Top 100 Mathematical Theorems]] that are formalised in Coq (see also [[http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/]]).
 * [[CoRN]] : a large library of formalised mathematics built on top of Coq
