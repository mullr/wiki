= Mathematics Formalized in Coq =

There is a great deal of mathematics (including some of the Top100MathematicalTheorems) already formalized in Coq. Some of the material is available in StandardLibrary or in the Coq's repository of [[http://coq.inria.fr/contribs-eng.html|user contributions]].

 * Top100MathematicalTheoremsInCoq: a list of Top100MathematicalTheorems that are formalised in Coq (see also [[http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/]]).
 * [[CoRN]] : a large library of formalised mathematics built on top of Coq
