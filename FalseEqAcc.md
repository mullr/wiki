Do False, eq, and Acc have a special status?

Although these inductives are in Prop, their values can be destruct while constructing objects of type Set.

This applies to all inductives of type Prop that are:

1. empty: without no constructors (e.g. False)
1. singleton: having one single constructor, whose arguments (if any) are all of type Prop
