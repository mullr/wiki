 * <<Date(2005-07-04T20:32:09Z)>>  Secure URL [[https://cocorico.cs.ru.nl/coqwiki]] works (the usual URL [[http://cocorico.cs.ru.nl/coqwiki]] still works and should be faster)
 * <<Date(2006-12-07T16:33:47Z)>> Upgrade to !MoinMoin 1.5.6
 * <<Date(2007-01-30T18:59:45Z)>>  The [[Cocorico!WikiLicense]] is modified. The new license is as permissive as the previous one; it is the ''simple permissive license'' of the [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell|HaskellWiki]].
 * <<Date(2007-10-26T09:32:21Z)>> [[http://labix.org/snippets/moin-title|This patch by Gustavo Niemeyer]] is applied. Now it is possible to use `#title` instruction on top of a page to change its title. 
 * <<Date(2007-12-11T18:44:59+0200)>> Cocorico! has '''moved''' to  [[http://logical.futurs.inria.fr/cocorico]].  The new server runs !MoinMoin 1.6.0beta1.
