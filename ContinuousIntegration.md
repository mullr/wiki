= How to compile all coq-contribs with a chosen Coq branch =

On our [[https://ci.inria.fr/coq|Jenkins server]],
in the [[https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/make|"make" view]],
there is a [[https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/make/job/coq-contribs|"coq-contribs" job]].

When you start it, you can specify which coq-repository to clone, which branch to check out etc.
All coq-contribs will then be rebuilt with the Coq version you have chosen.
