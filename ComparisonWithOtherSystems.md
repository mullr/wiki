There are a number of automatic theorems proovers and math formalization systems. Some of them:

 * [http://www.mizar.org Mizar]
 * [http://ghilbert.org GHilbert]
 * [http://planetmath.org PlanetMath]
 * [http://au.metamath.org/index.html Metamath]
 * [http://isabelle.in.tum.de/index.html Isabelle]

It would be nice to give brief list of their advantages and disadvantages compared to Coq. 

=== Why you should choose Coq ===

It's free. Coq is licensed under GPL and standard library is LGPL, so it's much easier to modify it and
develop it. For example, although Mizar has very large theorems collection, there is no prover source available.

It's strict. Comparing Coq to wiki-ba sed systems like [http://planetmath.org PlanetMath] shows it's that Coq is much nicer organized. Although it's easy to contribute to wiki system, it's hard to manage them. It's hard to trust just wiki.
