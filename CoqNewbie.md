Resources for Newbies

Well, thinking in Coq is not hard. It just requires some time to learn syntax and basic tactics. After that you'll be able to create almost any possible proof. Of course, it's better to start with [Coq FAQ](https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/The-Coq-FAQ). The library also contains a lot of small proofs and can help a lot to get started: <https://coq.inria.fr/library/>.
