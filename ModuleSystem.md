Module System
=============

-   Introduction to modules through a [ModuleSystemTutorial](ModuleSystemTutorial).
-   [ModulesForTheories](ModulesForTheories): Using modules and records to capture mathematical theories.
-   [RecordsNotModules](RecordsNotModules): Why you shouldn't use the module system at all, and use dependent records instead.
-   [ModulesNotRecords](ModulesNotRecords): Why the previous line does not always stand.
-   [ProofTermsConsideredHarmful](ProofTermsConsideredHarmful): Why using dependent records can be difficult, and sometimes inadvisable.
-   [TypeClasses](TypeClasses) (experimental in Coq 8.2) can also be used to capture mathematical theories, like in [IsabelleTheoremProver](IsabelleTheoremProver). They use parameterized dependent records internally.
-   [ModulesBibliography](ModulesBibliography): Various pointers to modules in systems like Coq.
-   [OpenIssuesWithModules](OpenIssuesWithModules): A discussion on various issues about Coq module system and how to address them.
