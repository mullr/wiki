= Module System =
 * Introduction to modules through a ModuleSystemTutorial.
 * ModulesForTheories: Using modules and records to capture mathematical theories.
 * RecordsNotModules: Why you shouldn't use the module system at all, and use dependent records instead.
 * ModulesNotRecords: Why the previous line does not always stand.
 * ProofTermsConsideredHarmful:  Why using dependent records can be difficult, and sometimes inadvisable.
 * TypeClasses (experimental in Coq 8.2) can also be used to capture mathematical theories, like in IsabelleTheoremProver.  They use parameterized dependent records internally.
 * ModulesBibliography: Various pointers to modules in systems like Coq.
 * OpenIssuesWithModules: A discussion on various issues about Coq module system and how to address them.
