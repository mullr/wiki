== Bug squashing ==
A list of [[https://coq.inria.fr/cocorico/CoqImplementorsWorkshop/CoqIW2016/bsp|relatively simple bugs]], to kill the time ;-)

Also, [[https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/|bug triaging]] is very welcome (check if a bug is still valid, add extra info, close solved bugs...).

== "Little" projects ==

=== Finish the safe string patch ===

A good little project is to submit some cleanups for -safe-string as hinted in https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/134

=== Fix Ocaml Warnings ===

Compiling Coq with Ocaml Warning enabled provides interesting cases to look at for cleanups. More details in Bug: https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4671

A special interesting project is to get the kernel to compile warning clean with *all warnings enabled*.

Using Merlin is highly recommended for this task.
