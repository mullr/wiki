When I run CoqIDE under KDE (specifically Kubuntu) all the symbols are wrong and it crashes when I open the query window. My solution to this problem was to reconfigure how KDE handles GTK applications (such as CoqIDE).

In Kubuntu I go to System Settings -&gt; Appearance -&gt; GTK styles and fonts. Under GTK styles I select `Use another style` and chose the Raleigh style. This solve the problem for me. Someone with a more detailed understanding of what is wrong and how to fix it is welcome to improve this document.
