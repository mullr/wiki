Now that you know the basics of Coq you are itching to prove somthing.  Here are some ideas.

Fermat's last theorem has been proven in Coq for the ''n''=4 case. The proof is available in UserContributions/CNAM/Fermat4/ .

= Tarski's Undefinability of Truth =

== Informal Statement ==

The set of numbers which encode true sentences of number theory, is not definable as a predicate in number theory.

== Resources ==

This theorem should be a direct consequence of [http://coq.inria.fr/contribs/GodelRosser.html the Gödel-Rosser Incompleteness Theorem] as defined in the Coq contribution.

The idea is that if the truth predicate were definable, then the set of true statements in number theory would be form a consistent axiom system that is able to represent it's own axioms.  This contradicts the Gödel-Rosser Incompleteness Theorem.

However, Tarski's Undefinability of Truth may be easy enough to prove directly given the framework of the [http://coq.inria.fr/contribs/GodelRosser.html the Gödel-Rosser Incompleteness Development].

= Elliptic Curve Primality Proving =

== Informal Statement ==

Let ''n'' be an integer, not divisible by 2 or 3.  Let ''A'', ''B'' be in Z,,n,, , and gcd (4*''A''^3^ + 27*''B''^2^, ''n'') = 1, and let ''L'' be in E(''A'',''B'')(Z,,n,,), with L <> I.  If ''qL'' = I, for some prime ''q'' > n^1/2^ + 2*n^1/4^ +1, then ''n'' is prime.

== Comments ==

The above theorem is the key theorem used to verify primality certificates generated by the Goldswasser-Kilian algorithm.  This can be used to extend the primality verification in Coq done by Martijn Oostdijk, Olga Caprotti, and Benjamin Gregoire.

The work would probably result in a nice reusable theory of elliptic curves over finite fields.

I believe the inequality in the theorem is equivalent to (''q''^2^ + ''n'' - ''q'' + 1)^2^ > (3 + ''q'')^2^*n and (''q'' - 1)^2^ > ''n''.

== Informal Statement ==

Any strongly disjoint pair of analytic sets is strongly Borel sepearable.

== Comments ==

Peter Aczel has a proof in constructive ZF.  It should be possible to translate this proof into type theory.
