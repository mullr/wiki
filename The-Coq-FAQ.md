This FAQ is the sum of the questions that came to mind as we developed proofs in Coq. Since we are singularly short-minded, we wrote the answers we found on bits of papers to have them at hand whenever the situation occurs again. This is pretty much the result of that: a collection of tips one can refer to when proofs become intricate. Yes, this means we won't take the blame for the shortcomings of this FAQ. But if you want to contribute and send in your own question and answers, feel free to add your own contributions to this wiki.
