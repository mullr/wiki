This file is created from scratch. Feel free to enlarge/shorten/modify it. It is tried that the `level`s given here are consistent with the output of 
`Print Grammar constr` command.  Yet some levels are chosen arbitrarily, for the apparent lack of a better alternative at the time of the creation.  -- MiladNiqui [[DateTime(2005-05-31T16:53:09Z)]]
