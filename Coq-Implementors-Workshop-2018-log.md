### Jim:

- With Emilio, made some progress on printing diffs between proof steps (https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/6801)
- Talked to Erik about getting Proof General to use the info produced by the proof diff code
- Discussion with Maxime about possible next projects for me
- Talk to Th√©o about improving the documentation.  I plan to make this my next project.
- Heard from Emilio about plans to use the Language Support Protocol to interface Coq to VSCode and other IDEs.  This would make CoqIde obsolete and save us from the considerable work required to provide a GUI ourselves.
- Short conversations about how to make Coq more powerful.  The Language Server Protocol may let us add helpful status displays in the various IDEs.
